# Book Analysis 2016
Data supporting analysis originally published in [Writing on Glass](https://www.writingonglass.com).

* For a list of book lists and links, see book-lists.csv
* For the book recommendations and race/gender/age data, see book-recommendations.csv
* See analysis.ipynb for IPython notebook code to generate charts. (Very unpolished - apologies!)
* A few books were omitted because of anonymous or pseudonymous authorship

This project used [Altair](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair), an awesome new Python data viz library. Check it out!
