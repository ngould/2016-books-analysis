# Book Analysis 2016
Data supporting analysis originally published in [Writing on Glass](https://www.writingonglass.com/content/best-book-lists-data).

* For a list of book lists and links, see book-lists.csv
* For the book recommendations and race/gender/age data, see book-recommendations.csv
* See analysis.ipynb for IPython notebook code to generate charts. (Very unpolished - apologies!)
* A few books were omitted because of anonymous or pseudonymous authorship

We would love to see others use this data for their own analysis. (And if you do, it would be super nice if you could credit or link to Writing on Glass.)

By the way, this project used [Altair](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair), an awesome new Python data viz library. Check it out!
